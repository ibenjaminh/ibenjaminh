# Hello, I'm Izaac 👋

## About Me

I'm a committed, motivated, and goal-driven individual with a keen interest in software engineering. My journey in tech is fueled by a relentless pursuit of knowledge, taking me through  courses like Harvard's CS50 and interactive learning on Codecademy. While I'm proud of every step I take, my projects like the *Tea Cozy* website and the *ATM Machine* simulation hold a special place in my portfolio — they symbolize the start of a promising journey.

## My Toolbox 🛠

- **Languages**: Proficient in C, C++, HTML, and CSS.
- **Currently Learning**: Diving deeper into Data Structures to solidify my foundation in software engineering.

## Goals 🎯

Short-term, I'm focused on building a robust portfolio of projects to become internship-ready. Each project is a step towards not just demonstrating my skills, but also understanding the intricacies of software development.

## Let's Connect 🌐

I'm always on the lookout for collaboration opportunities and love to engage in discussions around tech, programming, and innovations. If you're interested in teaming up, brainstorming project ideas, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out!
